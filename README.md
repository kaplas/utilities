Micro utilities used by author's various different small microservices

## Usage

```
npm start               # Start server
npm run lint            # Lint code files
now                     # Deploy to now.sh
now alias               # Assign production aliases from now.json
```

There is no CI setup â€“ deployments are done manually using `now`.
